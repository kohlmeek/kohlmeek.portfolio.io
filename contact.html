    <h1>Artists Statement</h1>
    <p><font size="4">Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Kohl Meek, and I’m a digital media artist and illustrator. I’ve always enjoyed telling jokes and making others laugh, which one can probably ascertain by looking at my work. My pieces tend to be playful, and colorful, occasionally tied rather directly to some form of humor or japery. Who doesn’t like a little whimsy, after all? My work is primarily digital but my range of work within that space is fairly diverse. I’m partial to working with 3d modeling and digital illustration, but I’ve done everything from creating games to coding the site that you currently gaze upon with undoubtedly euphoric fervor. Whenever I have a project in mind I go through the process of learning the skills required to see it through, and so my range of skills, as well as my range of interests are ever-expanding. Disparate as these different mediums may make my work seem, it’s all connected by a pervasive sense of fun and child-like glee. </font></p>

           <h1>Artists Bio</h1>
          <p><font size="4">Kohl Meek was born in Santa Cruz California in November of 1997. From a young age, Meek showed great interest in technology and computers, spending much of his time playing video games, or trying to understand the mysteries of his father’s computer. He pursued this interest through his childhood and teenage years, taking any classes within the digital realm his schools offered. It wasn’t until high school that Meek began to develop an interest in art, and in particular character design. After a brief spell as an engineering student, Meek began studying digital media art at San Jose State University, from which he recieved his BFA in 2020. Meek’s work seeks to capture a playful sense of joy through the use of bright colors, simple graphic shapes, and work based around or inspired by humor. He hopes that his work serves as a platform through which he can make people laugh.</font>
