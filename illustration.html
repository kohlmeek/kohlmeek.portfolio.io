                <p class="label">Stranded a millenium in the past, this mysterious stranger is looking for a way home. However he has a habit of getting side tracked and consistently gets tied up in historically significant events dispite his best efforts to avoid them. Often it is only through his presence or direct intervention that events transpire in the way he knows they're supposed to. His allegiances switch constantly to maintain his version of history. All thats certain about him is that if he's on your side things will probably go well for you. At first a hinderance, hes learned to use the time distortions that follow him to his advantage. </p>

            <p class="label">Struck with a critical case of wanderlust at a young age, Gunnar and his small friend Beak set off from their home village as soon as they could to wander the world. when compared to his immense bulk, Gunnars timid and soft spoken disposition hardly registers, and he gets pulled into all sorts of misadventures. After decades of this he's developed a quiet but profound wisdom that helps guide the duo, occasionally outweighed by an equally profound curiosity that pulls them into places they may not belong</p>

           <p class="label">Vince worked himself up from nothing but his wits and charm to become a middle manager in his local overlords empire. Then he was laid off due to downsizing. However he managed to escape before they revoked his rights to use the empire's undead minions. He's now struck out on his own to become a mercenary. Whatever problems he encounters that cant be solved with guile and trickery can be solved with a horde of business casual skeletons, but he prefers it not come to that. </p>

             <p class="label">Returned from the dead with no memories of her life, the kind hearted Mara just wants a friend. This is slightly complicated by the fact that she refelxively reacts to the living with a barrage of terrifying illusions that only become more intense relative to the amount of fear experienced by her victims. In large groups this can quickly spiral out of control. Mara struggles tirelessly to contain her illusions, but until she can it seems shes destined to be lonely</p>

                <p class="label">Allami Baqri's bid for ultimate knowledge ended in disaster when the demon she summoned took her wife as a vessel. She vowed not to return home until she found a way to save them. A lifetime passed, but not even her failing body could stop her search. After centuries she managed to find the ritual she had searched so single mindedly for, but little of herself remianed, her limbs and organs replaced with clockework fascimilies, and her memory in tatters. She no longer knows why she started her quest, but is determined to find out as she tries to follow her trail to where it all started. Through indominatable will, impressive magical ability, and a multitude of tricks built into her new body, very little could stand in her way.</p>

                  <p class="label">The head of a mid tier bandit organisation, Jesse had all she could want for but over the course of 
                  a single night it all dissappeared. Disfigured, rendered mute, and betrayed by her liutenants she was left with nothing but a hatred and lust for revenge burning
                  with the intensity and fury of a thousand suns. Only one lieutenant remains. He had the good sense to disappear when the others were found dead,
                  their toungues cut out. His trail has grown cold, but Jesse is relentless and when she finds him, he will know the full extent of her hatred.</p>

                ruin when a lab accident left him a conciousness suspended in toxic fluids. But not even the corruption of his body could 
                break his spirit, or his drive to save the worlds ailing. He travels from town to town doing all the good he can, never forgetting that
                all that stands in the way of his patients death are his knowledge and a hazard suit that feels all too thin.</p>
