        <p>I like to draw in my free time.
          I have a fondness for drawing characters, and have a fairly cartoony style. Everything on this sight
            was drawn digitally using a Wacom tablet. I usually work in Paint Tool Sai, but occasionally mess around with
            Manga Studio Pro for line work, and Photoshop for color.<br><br>
