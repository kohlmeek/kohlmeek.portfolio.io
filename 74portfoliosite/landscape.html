 <h1>3D Printing</h1>
    <p>For this project I worked in a group of four to make a 3d printed landscape based on a model we would either create, or find and edit in Sketchup, which may be the most infuriatingly inconvenient program to ever be concieved by man. Our project focused on taking the San Jose city scape, and breaking it into neighborhoods, then elevatng those neighborhoods based on crime rates. 
    We ended up with a strange pyramid, and added land marks to clarify what was in each area. The result was simple, but took an ungodly amount of time.

        <p>Here's a picture of a more or less final iteration of the 3D model
            we made for this project. Everything in shades of gray is stuff that we
            made from scratch, while anything in color is downloaded from the <a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/?hl=en">3D warehouse</a>

        <p>Heres an example of what you get when you print out the above model at a fast speed
            and the dimensions of about 1 square inch.
