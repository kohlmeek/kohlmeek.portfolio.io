    <h1>Digital Media Montage</h1>
    <p>Ever do a collage? Well, this is that, but with .Jpegs instead of pictures. The project for this one was to 
    make a montage with at least 20 images, ten from the internet and ten we took ourselves. We were also meant to 
    have the montage tell a story or deliver a message. Mine is written in depth below.
    <br><br>
    I ran into a few stumbling blocks on this project, most having to do with the clarity of my message. Originally 
    the monkeys and people in the middleground weren't mirroring each other, so it gave more an impression of people being distracted
        by their phones than about what I had intended. There was also consistent problems with the how the people in the background looked. 
        They had a feeling of being hastily cut out, which didn't mesh with the rest of the mostly realistic vibe. In the end I ended up taking advantage
        of the elements and importing new images in to obscure these oddities.

        <img src="images/montage-screen-res.jpg" width="80%">
        <p>Despite humanity’s technological advancement we are still just animals. We are still controlled by our instincts, drives, and urges, same as the monkeys.
<br><br>
	This was the simple concept I was trying to get across with my montage. I went about doing so by displaying a scene of people viewing a monkey enclosure in which all of the monkeys are using phones, or other pieces of popular technology. The people outside of the enclosure are also all beholden to their own phones. I was hoping that displaying the monkeys and humans doing the same thing would highlight how similar we really are. I considered having people acting like monkeys, but that just seemed to muddle the message. 
<br><br>
	In the words of George Carlin “We're barely out of the jungle on this planet. Barely out of the fucking jungle. What we are, is semi-civilized beasts, with baseball caps and automatic weapons”. We like to act like we’re somehow different than the rest of the animals on earth, that we’re better because we can construct a factory, build a car, or even make something as elaborate and far reaching as the internet, but all these things were made for the same reason, and to reach the same end, to satisfy our very animalistic desires. The internet is just a tool that allows us to fulfill our human social drives more conveniently and at lesser risk of bodily harm. We’re just doing the same things we’ve always done. The only difference is how different people tend to believe that humanity is going through an enormous shift.
